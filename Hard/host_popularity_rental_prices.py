""" Host Popularity Rental Prices


Youâ€™re given a table of rental property searches by users. The table consists of search results and outputs host information for searchers. Find the minimum, average, maximum rental prices for each hostâ€™s popularity rating. The hostâ€™s popularity rating is defined as below:
0 reviews: New
1 to 5 reviews: Rising
6 to 15 reviews: Trending Up
16 to 40 reviews: Popular
more than 40 reviews: Hot


Tip: The id column in the table refers to the search ID. You'll need to create your own host_id by concating price, room_type, host_since, zipcode, and number_of_reviews.


Output host popularity rating and their minimum, average and maximum rental prices.
